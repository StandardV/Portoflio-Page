# Portoflio-Page

## Greeting

Welcome to my portfolio page, my name is Vuong, and please allow me to show you around

I made this website with the intention to develop it overtime as my skills growth, it included 4 pages with each of them being carefully picked and designed by me, choosing the best design is a big confusion to me at first but it worked out in the end

## What I learned from this

To add into the details, this is the first big website project that I have ever made, I encountered quite a few technical difficulty but it sure had taught me a lot

 *Instead of bootstrap, I decided to use some pre-written card-body for the project page, which look quite neat and clean
 *Contact information could also be something that I need to considered due to the fact that there are a lot web scrapping service outthere that just enter sites and scrape for it email whether it is legally or illegally
 *Postition relative and absolute is also something really nice to think about, it provide the flexibility when creating the site, allow you to put box and div where you wanted it to be without much hassle
 *I also learned to utilize display flex and display grid as much as possible
 *Some JQuerry and Javascript is still new to me, so I'm questioning myself whether or not should I use python to fill the gap. But part of JS seem familiar to python, so I'll still give JS a try
 
 Lastly, Thank you for reading!!!
